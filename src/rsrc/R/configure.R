#' @description Returns a list of file paths and other project-wide constants.
#' @details The criterion for a configuration value to get specified here
#' (and not just in the script where it's needed) is if the same value
#' will be needed across multiple scripts
#' @param check_dirs If true, check that all defined dirs entries exist on the
#' user's system
#' @param filepath Full path where `example_config` got saved (see CTS `README.md`). The NULL 
#' default is generally sufficient, but you may need to set this separately if you're setting
#' this up in the context of shiny-server.
